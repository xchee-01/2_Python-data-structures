# Introduction to Data Structure in Python
## What are Data Structures?
Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. They help us manage data efficiently and effectively. Python provides several built-in data structures and allows us to create custom ones. We have briefly seen some data types and structures previously. Now we will do a deeper dive on this topic

## Why is it important to know data strucutres? 
1. Efficiency: Different data structures offer different performance characteristics
2. Organization: They help structure data in meaningful ways
3. Problem-solving: Choosing the right data structure is often key to solving computational problems
